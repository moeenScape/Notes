## Keyboard Shortcut
#### Shift Shift 
The ultimate shortcut is search everywhere.  Double pressing the shift key opens a search box that lets us look for anything. Like find action, 
we can use it for changing settings. By default, the search box shows the recent files, so we can use this instead 
of ⌘E / Ctrl+E.  If we type something to look for, we can see results from classes, files, symbols, and actions.  
Search everywhere also supports commands, so for example we can search for settings for the editor.

#### B or Ctrl+B
We often want to navigate the code from within the code. With ⌘B (MacOS), or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux) we can go 
to the declaration of a symbol. For example, pressing this on a field will take the cursor to the field declaration.  
Pressing it on a class name will take us to the class file.  If we press ⌥⌘B (MacOS) or Ctrl+Alt+B (Windows/Linux), we can navigate to an implementation instead.
