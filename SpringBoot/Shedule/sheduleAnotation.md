###Cron Syntax

Cron is a time-based job scheduling format used in Unix-like operating systems. It consists of five fields that specify when a command should run. These fields are:

- **Minute (0 - 59)**: Specifies the minute of the hour when the command should execute.
- **Hour (0 - 23)**: Specifies the hour of the day when the command should execute.
- **Day of the Month (1 - 31)**: Specifies the day of the month when the command should execute.
- **Month (1 - 12)**: Specifies the month when the command should execute.
- **Day of the Week (0 - 6)**: Specifies the day of the week when the command should execute (Sunday to Saturday; 7 is also Sunday on some systems).

Here is an example of the cron syntax:
